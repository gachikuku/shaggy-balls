# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2022-07-01

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What's next

Want to make a aesthetically pleasing meme site about shaggy balls.

PS: I get frequently between snaggy and shaggy balls so please correct me along the way it's hard for me to keep track
    really both are funny and secretly can't decide between the two but for the official sh*t we going with shaggy-balls.
